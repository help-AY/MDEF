## 01_intervention - just-make series_tote
november 2022

<iframe width="910" height="512" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cmkV1NR8Gg0" title="221106_Just-Make-Series_001_Tote-Bag" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

the challenge now was to design a certain article, whether it be a pair of pants or a tote bag (keep in mind that i have no prior experience in textiles) and invite a few people to join this small intervention to create a small intimate workshop (without assessing their skills prior). this idea of a small "production party" - prodparty for short (coined by our friend - korbi). also acted as a small networkijng event. we all talked, learned, understood and shared a decent amount of information, both related to the workshop and not.
