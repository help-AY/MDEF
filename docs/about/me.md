# who is ahmed?

![](../images/profilepic.jpg)

usually a curious, sometimes anxious, designer.

i have multiple interests in life, but lately i have really been trying to find myself away from the corporate/commercial reality. i am so tired of working from money - i want to work for a purpose instead.

 my background in architecture gives me the world's respect and skill to help change reality for many people. our studies helped us realize the human thinking aka "thinking as the user". i just want to use my skill to make a positive change in the world.

 is it a selfish goal to want to change someone else's life, in order to find purpose? that is for me to find out. but hopefully not :)
