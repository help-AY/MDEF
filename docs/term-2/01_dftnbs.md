january_2023

(this text is too formal for my liking lol) 

this module of the course allowed us to reimagine a world that does not just have one "linear" future but instead multiple spiral futures. there was an emphasis on the use of critical hope as well as multiple hypothetical questions to discuss and reflect over differenct subjects of conversation.
