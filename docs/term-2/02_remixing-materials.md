# remixing materials
january_2023

under the expert guidance of laura campos, our remixing materials workshop came to life with a dynamic start! we were given an insightful glimpse into Simbiotica, laura's unique approach to using and experimenting with bio-materials. i was  drawn in by her engaging presentation, which sparked my imagination as she delved into the rich history of these materials, the intricacies of the design process, and the endless possibilities for design applications. It was a truly entertaining and enlightening experience that left a lasting impression.
