# remixing materials
january_2023

part 1.

under the expert guidance of laura campos, our remixing materials workshop came to life with a dynamic start! we were given an insightful glimpse into Simbiotica, laura's unique approach to using and experimenting with bio-materials. i was  drawn in by her engaging presentation, which sparked my imagination as she delved into the rich history of these materials, the intricacies of the design process, and the endless possibilities for design applications. It was a truly entertaining and enlightening experience that left a lasting impression.

we did a lot of then and there experiments using a material of our choice to create a leather object using a mold and a naturally occuring resin - as well as a synthetic natural leather as a small introduction to bio-materials. quite educational but it was not my favorite part of this module.

material narratives + presentation

we were tasked to choose and analyse 3 materials - one from the class references, one from around us, and one ideal material.
