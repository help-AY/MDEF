## forensics of the obsolescense_

last few weeks were a refreshing change - we were introduced to the right to repair. the monolpoly some companies have over their products // this is what i thought was most important to learn and what stuck with me the most.

our first week was spent doing a forensics study - one in which we did a thorough examination of a "broken" device. my group jumped on the idea of breaking down the largest device possible :) a printer/scanner combo - an absolute unit.
