# community engagement
november_2022

the focus of this week was on the concepts of designing for specific communities, and through various role-playing exercises, i was able to not only connect with myself but also with my peers. The sessions, held in Holon, were facilitated by knowledgeable moderators who were skilled at addressing the class and providing insights.

despite my ongoing confusion regarding my goals and target audience, one thing is certain - i am passionate about breaking down the monopoly of design and introducing people to its fundamental principles. my aim is to educate while highlighting the significance of good design. 

the community I hope to reach includes individuals seeking to reinvent themselves, those stuck in unfulfilling jobs, those seeking education, and those wanting a break from the daily grind. additionally, i am also interested in reaching out to refugees, who often struggle the most and have a desire to learn new skills.

during the week, we visited several inspiring places, but the one that had the most impact on me was Cibico, where we saw how they transformed their niche design practice (space and graphic design) into something even more unique by adding another layer of complexity - the use of bio-material banners. This experience further solidified my dream of one day creating something similar.
