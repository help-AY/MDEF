# what is my fight?

In the fast-paced and often tumultuous modern world, it's not uncommon to feel overwhelmed by feelings of anxiety. With so many pressing issues and global challenges, it can be difficult to know where to start in making a difference. However, I realized that my first step towards making a positive impact in the world starts with facing my own fears and anxieties.

The world may seem like a chaotic and uncontrollable place, but by taking control of my own thoughts and emotions, I am better equipped to use my skills and talents to serve my community. Fear has the power to immobilize and hold us back, but I have chosen to fight against it and become the proactive and creative individual I have always dreamed of being.

This sentiment is echoed by Nobel Prize-winning Egyptian writer, Naguib Mahfouz, who once said, "Fear does not prevent death, but it prevents life." I take this quote to heart and strive to live a life free from the constraints of fear, so that I may fully embrace all that the world has to offer.
