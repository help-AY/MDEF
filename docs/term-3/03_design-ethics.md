# design ethics
may 2023

throughout the duration of the course, the perspective on the definition of technology underwent a significant transformation. it became evident that technology encompasses a much wider range of phenomena than just high-tech devices like iphones. the understanding grew that technology extends to concepts such as monoculture, which plays a significant role in shaping society. this realization led to an understanding that technology is far from being a neutral entity; rather, it is deeply intertwined with the values and priorities of the societies, communities, and influential groups that shape it. similarly, it was recognized that design itself is not a neutral practice but carries with it the intention to shape behavior and influence the world in specific ways.

one concept that profoundly resonated throughout the course was care ethics. this ethical framework highlights the intrinsic connection between an individual's well-being and their social context and community. it became increasingly clear that societal expectations often place the burden of personal well-being solely on the individual, disregarding the significant impact of environmental factors on their health. embracing the principles of care ethics, the importance of collective responsibility and designing environments and systems that genuinely foster the well-being of all individuals was realized.

moreover, the discussions surrounding professional ethics had a profound impact on one's own design practice. the realization that every individual possesses the capacity for design, and that the professional designer does not hold a position of superiority, was enlightening. it shifted the perspective and inspired a proactive approach to caring for others. understanding that professions are moral projects, the goal is to transform thinking from a passive "caring about" to an active and engaged "caring for" approach, actively contributing to the well-being of individuals and communities through design work.

these insights and realizations have shaped the understanding of technology, design, and ethics in profound ways. they have expanded the perspective and challenged preconceptions, encouraging an approach to work with a heightened awareness of the broader impact it can have on society. moving forward, the excitement lies in continuing to explore these themes and integrating them into design practice, striving to create positive and meaningful experiences for all.
