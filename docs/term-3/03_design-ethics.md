# design ethics
may 2023

Throughout the duration of this course, my perspective on the definition of technology has undergone a significant transformation. I have come to understand that technology encompasses a broader spectrum than merely high-tech devices such as iPhones; it also encompasses phenomena like monoculture. A particularly intriguing realization was that technology is far from being a neutral entity; instead, it serves as a reflection of the values and priorities held by a given society, community, or influential group. Likewise, design is not a neutral practice, as it carries with it the intent to shape behavior in specific ways.

One concept that has resonated deeply with me is Care Ethics. I have developed a profound appreciation for the notion that an individual's well-being is intimately intertwined with their social context and the community to which they belong. It has become increasingly evident that societal expectations often place the onus of personal well-being solely on the individual, often neglecting to consider the profound impact of environmental factors on their health. By embracing the principles of Care Ethics, it becomes possible to design environments and systems that genuinely foster the well-being of all individuals.

Lastly, the discussions surrounding professional ethics have proven highly applicable to my own design practice. I have been deeply moved by the notion that every individual possesses a capacity for design, and that the professional designer does not hold a position of superiority over others. This realization has served as a profound source of inspiration. Recognizing that professions are moral projects, I have come to embrace my role as a professional designer, with the ability to transform my perspective from a mere "caring about" to a proactive "caring for" approach.
