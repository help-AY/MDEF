# distributed design
april 2023

in this seminar called "reflecting on distributed design," we're delving into the world of distributed design. it's not just about making things; it's about sharing knowledge, value, and power. we're exploring the distributed design platform (ddp), where different approaches like doughnut economics, decolonizing design, ancestral wisdom, and transfeminism come together. using the ddp reflection tree tool, we'll measure the impact of our creative projects and reflect on their environmental and social effects. this seminar supports emerging talents in the creative industry, pushing the boundaries of distributed design.

we discussed the "futures design toolkit" - it's a valuable resource for designers, educators, and students aiming to create sustainable futures. they provide step-by-step processes, exercises, and examples of amazing projects from around the world. it's all about critical thinking, imagination, and collaborating to tackle sustainability challenges.

during our group activities, we explored objects like a plastic hair-clip, chatgpt, fertilizer, and bread. we asked questions, shared ideas, and had some eye-opening interactions. who knew a simple hair-clip could have different cultural values?

we also worked individually on the distributed design platform reflection tree. after scoring our projects, we discussed them as a group. we agreed that being open-source is important, but it's not just about being easy to replicate. clear project descriptions and understandable resources are crucial for usefulness. we also realized the need to focus more on regenerating the environment, seher's project stood out as an exception within our group.

participation, collaboration, integration, and patience. these skills are essential for success. we had some fantastic dynamics in our group - horizontal, active, participatory, and creative. when we shared our perspectives and collaborated on presentations. we even received feedback from our classmates.

key outcomes - exploring the distributed design platform, utilizing the futures design toolkit, and honing our skills. it's all about being creative, making a positive impact and sharing our knowledge.
